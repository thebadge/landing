      "description": "To ensure that our initiatives to attract more people to the crypto ecosystem are fruitful, we must make the ecosystem trustworthy. To create a decentralized future, having accurate information is essential. If we as a decentralized community entrust all verification duty only to centralized entities, the entire ecosystem will suffer the consequences of bad actors' wrongdoings."
